The primary way of displaying the application's content inside Mergado pages is through the use of `IFRAME` elements. Furthermore, these `IFRAMEs` are [sandboxed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox) to eliminate security risks that may arise from using potentially untrusted content inside `IFRAMEs` that are placed in the middle of Mergado's own pages. Since sandboxed `IFRAMEs` cannot speak directly with the rest of the Mergado page and vice versa, some standard form of JavaScript communication between the app's viewport and the page around it must be defined.

Such standard form of communication is represented by the **Mergado App IFRAME API** *(Maia)* provided by Mergado platform. It is through this *API* that app's viewport `IFRAME` and Mergado wrapper page can communicate with each other.

**Important:** Be advised that -- since it provides some essential information about the contents of viewport, without which Mergado cannot display the `IFRAME` properly -- the placement and usage of Maia in all app's pages and viewports is mandatory. Applications that don't include Maia (or any *equivalent* implementation) in their pages' source code will be deemed unsatisfactory.

## Installation

To use the Maia in your app's viewports simply include the appropriate script file provided by Mergado into your page's HTML source. You can use either of these:

- The minified version (recommended):

  ```html
  <script src="https://app.mergado.com/static/js/apps/MessageApi.min.js" async></script>
  ```
- The non-minified one (more appropriate for debugging purposes or to see how it works):

  ```html
  <script src="https://app.mergado.com/static/js/apps/MessageApi.js" async></script>
  ```

## Usage

### What it does by itself

1. **When the `MessageAPI.js` script is loaded:**
After the script is executed, a new global `Mergado` variable containing a singleton object representing Maia is instantly available inside the app's viewport.

2. **When the app's `IFRAME` is loaded:**
   - After its content is loaded (i.e. the `IFRAME`'s `onload` event is fired) Mergado wrapper page sends a *"hello message"* to the app's `IFRAME`, which is instanteously intercepted by Maia residing inside of it. Maia then sends the height of viewport's content back to Mergado wrapper page, which then can update `IFRAME`'s height appropriately and the whole content of app's viewport will be visible.
   - All elements having a `data-download="somefileurl"` attribute will have a `onclick` event handler attached. When fired, a message will be sent to the wrapper page which will in turn display up a popup window with URL set to `somefileurl`. This is to overcome the limitations of Firefox browser, which is otherwise in most cases unwilling to start a file download from inside of an `IFRAME`.

### What you can do with it

The `Mergado` object has a number of methods which can be used to better your application, improve its usability or overcome any limitations that are the result of strict handling of sandboxed `IFRAME`s by web browsers.

Method | Parameters | Description
------ | ---------- | -----------
`Mergado.tellHeight(``[int heightInPixels])` | `heightInPixels` (optional): Can be set in pixels, `0` or `undefined` | The *wrapper page* will set height of app's viewport `IFRAME` to this number of pixels. If no height is passed, it will be determined automatically.
`Mergado.startDownload(``string url)` | `url`: Target URL to start download from | A new mini window will be popped up having *target URL* as its location. The window will be closed after 10 seconds; until then the target server has time to make a proper response. In this case most probably in a form of a file download.
`Mergado.openWindow(``string url)` | `url`: Target page URL | A new browser window will be opened having the *target URL* as its location. This window will NOT automatically close itself.

{: .warning}
**Warning:** Do not manually *copy & paste* contents of `MessageAPI.js` file into your page's source code. Always include the remote `MessageAPI.js` script file provided by Mergado platform at `https://app.mergado.com/static/js/apps/MessageApi.js` or `https://app.mergado.com/static/js/apps/MessageApi.min.js`. This way you can be sure you use the most up-to-date version of Maia.
