App's viewport can be placed in several possible contexts, based on the type of the application:

- *User* context: Application **can** be displayed in a context without any *e-shop ID* or *project ID* defined.
 - *User ID* is available through the [designated API endpoint](http://docs.mergado.apiary.io/#reference/core/users/authenticated-user).
- *E-shop* context: Application **can't** be displayed without an *e-shop ID* but **can** be displayed without any *project ID*.
 - *User ID* is available through the designated API endpoint.
 - *E-shop ID* is available in the current viewport's URL.
- *Project* context: Application **can't** be displayed without both *e-shop ID* and *project ID*.
 - *User ID* is available through the designated API endpoint.
 - *E-shop ID* is available in the current viewport's URL.
 - *Project ID* is also available in the current viewport's URL.

## URL Form

App's primary viewport:

```
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myapp/[eshop/<eshopId>/][project/<projectId>]
```

App's widget viewport:

```
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myapp/widget/[eshop/<eshopId>/][project/<projectId>]
```

### Examples

#### App for eshops

*MyEshopsApp* is of type `eshop`, all these URLs are valid:

```
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myeshopsapp/eshop/123/project/456
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myeshopsapp/eshop/123
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myeshopsapp/widget/eshop/123/project/456
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myeshopsapp/widget/eshop/123
```

#### App for projects

*MyProjectsApp* is of type `project`, these URLs are valid:

```
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myprojectsapp/eshop/123/project/456
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myprojectsapp/widget/eshop/123/project/456
```

Behaviour of `project` app without having *project ID* specified in its URL is ***undefined***.

```
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myprojectsapp/eshop/123
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myprojectsapp/widget/eshop/123
```

#### App for users

*MyUsersApp* is of type `user`, all these URLs are valid:

```
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myusersapp/eshop/123/project/456
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myusersapp/eshop/123
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myusersapp/
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myusersapp/widget/eshop/123/project/456
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myusersapp/widget/eshop/123
https://appcloud.mergado.com/apps/myusersapp/widget/
```

{: .info}
We know PHP is not suited to handle this style of routing - not without an additional code, some framework or an external library parsing these *pretty-URLs*. Because we don't want to force developers to have to use third-party libraries by default, an additional option is planned to have the routing in a form of GET parameters, which will better suit the way of how *pure PHP* works.

## Front controller & .htaccess

Because the only currently supported routing system follows the *pretty-URL* style, you'll most definitely want to use a front controller pattern with `.htaccess` in the app's public root handling the collection of requests.

Below is the of configuration you can use in your app's `/www/.htaccess` file to handle pointing all requests to the single `/www/index.php` directory:

```
RewriteEngine On

# Build Mergado App Cloud rewrite base URL.
SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI (/apps/.+?/) MERGADO_APPCLOUD_REWRITE_BASE=$1

# Redirect trailing slashes if not a directory.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ %{env:MERGADO_APPCLOUD_REWRITE_BASE}$1 [L,R=301]

# Handle front controller.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ %{env:MERGADO_APPCLOUD_REWRITE_BASE}index.php [L]
```
